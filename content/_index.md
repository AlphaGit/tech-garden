title: Alpha's Tech Garden
---

## Get Started
This is a digital knowledge garden generated with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

## Why?
Because a "blog" feels like it needs to have some research and finished idea behind it. Because quick dirty notes are perfect here. Because interlinking is really easy in Obsidian.

Also, because it's look to see it all in a graph~

## Some links to navigate
Try the search, regardless!

- [All Notes](/notes)
- Programming Languages
	- [CSS](/tags/css)
- Security
	- [SSL](/tags/ssl)

## Pending work
Pending work for this garden is:
- [ ] Remove Quartz default pages (after reading them!)
- [x] Give a nice URL to it, using a custom domain
- [x] Start filling up some notes!
