title: Alpha's Tech Garden
---

## Get Started
This is a digital knowledge garden generated with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

## Why?
Because a "blog" feels like it needs to have some research and finished idea behind it. Because quick dirty notes are perfect here. Because interlinking is really easy in Obsidian.

Also, because it's look to see it all in a graph~
