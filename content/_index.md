## What is this?

This is a digital knowledge garden generated with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

## Who am I?

Don't we all want to know? I'm Alpha, the figure behind [Alpha's Manifesto](https://blog.alphasmanifesto.com)

## Why another site?

Because a "blog" feels like it needs to have some research and finished idea behind it. Because quick-and-dirty notes are perfect here. Because interlinking is really easy in Obsidian.

Also, because it's really cool to see it all in a graph~

Use the **Explorer** on the left, or use the search (`Ctrl+K`  or `Cmd+K`) and input any text your heart desires.
