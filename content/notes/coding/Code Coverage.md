## Different metrics for code coverage

> Code coverage is a metric that measures the percentage of source code your tests execute. It helps you identify areas that may lack proper testing.[^1]

> _Function coverage_ is a straightforward metric. It captures the percentage of functions in your code that your tests call.[^1]

> _Line coverage_ measures the percentage of executable code lines that your test suite executed.[^1]

> _Branch coverage_ measures the percentage of executed branches or decision points in the code, such as if statements or loops.[^1]

> _Statement coverage_ measures the percentage of statements in your code that your tests execute. At first glance, you might wonder, “isn’t this the same as line coverage?” Indeed, statement coverage is similar to line coverage but takes into account single lines of code that contain multiple statements.[^1]
