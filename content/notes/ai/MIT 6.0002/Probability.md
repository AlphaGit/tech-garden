## Probability
**Probability** is all about counting. We count all of the possible states and the states of interest. The ratio is the probability of our state of interest.

This definition implies:
- Probabilities are a number between 0 to 1.
- If the probability of an event ocurring is $p$, the probability of it not ocurring is $1 - p$ .
- When events are independent, the probability of them happening together is equal to the product of each of the independent events.

Two events are **independent** if the outcome of one has no influence on the outcome of the other. A common mistake is to assume independence when that is not the case.

## Sample probability
Running a simulation to detect the probabiliy of something might give wrong results, because the event of interest might happen at a different rate. This is called a **sample probability**, opposed to the true probability of an event. For simulations, doing a lot more tests usually helps.
