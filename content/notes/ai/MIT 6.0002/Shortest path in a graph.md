- A type of [[notes/ai/MIT 6.0002/Optimization models|Optimization problem]]
- Can be on the amount of steps (amount of edges traversed).
- Can be on the weights of the edges (sums of weights).

## Weighted shortest path in a graph
Similar to above, but instead of summing up the counts of edges, sum the weights of the edges to consider the shortest path.
