> The key idea is this: a user asks a question. You search your private documents for content that appears relevant to the question, then paste excerpts of that content into the LLM (respecting its size limit, usually between 3,000 and 6,000 words) along with the original question.
> 
> The LLM can then answer the question based on the additional content you provided.
