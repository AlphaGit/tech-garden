AutoKeying allows the user to record movements/distorions (rotations, scaling, etc) and have those be automatically keyframed as the timeline progresses in real time.

Later on modifications can be done on the Graph editor to smooth/adjust the keyframing, but this allows for a more natural and complex animation movement to be setup without having to deal with specific keys and movements step by step.
