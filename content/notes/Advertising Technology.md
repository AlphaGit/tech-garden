**Kevel** documentation has a wonderful glossary of several terms used in the AdTech industry ([source](https://dev.kevel.co/docs/glossary)):

## Metrics

| **Conversions (Actions)** | Number of post-click actions (such as making a purchase, filling out a form, etc) |
| **Impressions** | When an ad is displayed on the site/app |
| **Viewable Impressions** | Technical term for number of impressions where at least half of the ad was shown for at least 2 seconds |
| **Video Views** | How many times a video ad was viewed. Sometimes broken down by how far the user got into it, like 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% completed. |

| **Cost per click (CPC)** | Total cost (ad spend) divided by clicks |

## Types of Custom Ads

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Companion Ads** | Ads from the same advertiser that appear in tandem. Often refers to display ads that appear alongside a video ad, such as on YouTube |
| **Dynamic Ads** | Catch-all term for ads that change depending on who is viewing it. For instance, showing rain gear to people who are currently living somewhere where it is raining |
| **Full-Screen Takeover** | An ad that takes over the entire screen (most relevant on mobile) |
| **In-Feed/In-Stream Ads** |An ad that appears within the flow of content, such as Facebook's mobile in-feed ad unit |
| **Promoted/Sponsored Post** | Native ads - often on social networking sites - that look and feel like organic posts. Think Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, etc |
| **Recommendation Widgets** | The rectangular 'around the web' content ads you often see on media/news sites |
| **Responsive Ads** | Ads that automatically change size based on screen/browser size |
| **Session Takeover** | Where you show the same user the same ad (or ads from the same advertiser) for their entire browsing session |
| **Sponsored Articles** | Articles on news/media sites that are sponsored by a brand. Done correctly, these are not self-promotional (like H&R Block sponsoring an Onion article on taxes). However, there are also 'advertorials' - ads that promote a product while trying to look like objective editorial pieces |
| **Sponsored/Promoted Listings** | Used by eCommerce, marketplaces, and any company that shows "listings". Here, companies/people pay for their organic listing to be artificially high up in the search results. For instance, Amazon lets vendors pay to have their product be the first listing for a given search word |
| **Sponsored** | A custom native ad unit sponsored by a brand. Can be anything. Tinder has "sponsored profiles"; AllRecipes as "sponsored ingredients"; it's really up to your imagination! |
| **Viewable Ads** | To counter concerns that some ads are displayed but never seen, some advertisers may ask for 'viewable ads'. The IAB considers a viewable ad to have 50%+ of its pixels visible for at least 2 seconds |
