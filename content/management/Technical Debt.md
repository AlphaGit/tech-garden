Technical debt has less to do with the code itself and more about the choices and compromises that emerge from the challenges within software development.[^notreal]

In the realm of software development, the inception of a project is often marked by a paradoxical certainty: we know the least about the project at its beginning. This is an inherent trait, not a flaw, of the developmental process.[^notreal]

The concept of refactoring sprints, while seemingly a solution, is often misguided. The root problem often lies not in the code itself, but in the processes that built that code. In cases of what might be termed “corporate technical debt,” a continuous, proactive approach to managing technical debt is more effective than sporadic refactoring sprints.[^notreal]
