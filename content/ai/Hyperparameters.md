Since ML algorithms have the capability to learn the parameters that make them operate, the parameters that regulate how the learning takes place are named "hyper"-parameters.

Examples:

- [[Learning rate]]
- [[Epochs]]
- [[Early Stop]]
- [[Generation size]]
- [[Mutation rate]]
- [[Number of clusters]]
- [[Neural network architecture]]
- [[Activation functions|Activation function]]
- [[Weight initialization values]]
