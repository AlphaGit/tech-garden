## Refining prompts

To further refine your prompts, consider these strategies:

- **Write Clear Instructions**: Craft system messages and prompts that are precise and unambiguous. 
- **Split Complex Tasks**: Break down intricate tasks into simpler subtasks  
- **Leverage Few-Shot Learning**: After establishing the basics, Few-Shot Learning empowers the model to generalize from a few examples. 
- **Integrate Self-Explanation in Responses**: When crafting prompts, include a request for the LLM to not only provide an answer but also to explain its reasoning within the same response.
- **Use AI to Optimize Your Prompts**: When prompts are constructed with AI assistance, they tend to be clearer and more aligned with the model's processing, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the responses.
