**Inferential statistics**:
- **Population**: universe of all possible examples
- **Examples**: a proper subset of the population
- A **random sample** tends to exhibit the same properties as the population from which is drawn

These are the principles we applied when testing [[Random Walks|random walks]].

We make inferences about populations by examining one or more random [[Sampling|samples]] drawn from that population.
