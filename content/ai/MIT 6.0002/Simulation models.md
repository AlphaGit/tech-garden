A description of computations that provide useful information about the possible behaviours of a system being modeled. They're descriptive and not prescriptive (opposed to [[Optimization models|Optimization models]]).

Sometimes it's easier to run simulations than develop the actual math for the actual probability. Calculating the formula for the birthday problem for 3, 4 or more people is very difficult.
