More simulations (a larger sample) usually drives the [[Variance|variance]] down, which is why we have a better [[Confidence intervals|confidence]] in the results. This is the Law of Large numebrs:

> In repeated independent tests with the same actual probability $p$ of a particular outcome in each test, the chance that the franction of times that outcome occurs differs from $p$ converges to zero as the number of trials goes to infinity.
