**Nodes** (vertices) and **edges** (arcs). Nodes are elements in the systems. Edges are connections between them.

**Directed graphs**, where the connections have a direction.

Edges can have information, like weights.

Possible representations:

- **Adjacency matrix**: matrix where nodes are columns and rows, where they intersect there's a value in the matrix. For directed graphs, these matrices might not be symmetric.
- **Adjacency list**: for a node, list of associated nodes
