The Gambler's Fallacy: people expect that deviations from the expected occur, they will be evened out in the future.

>On August 18th, 1913, at the casino in Monte Carlo, black came up a record twenty-six times in succession \[in roulette]. ... \[There] was a near panicky-rush to bet on red, beggining about the time black had come up a phenomenal fifteen times."
>-- Huff and Geis, _How to take a chance_

Probability of 26-consecutive blacks: $1/{2^{26}} = 1/67,108,865$

Probability of 26-consecutive blacks when the previous 25 rolls where black: $1/2$, because the events are independent.
