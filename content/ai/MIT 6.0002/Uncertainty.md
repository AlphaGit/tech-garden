## Uncertainty

Most of the time, we're not really certain about facts. The world is not **functional** (same output for same input). Quantum mechanics and **casual nondeterminism**: nothing, at the core of reality, has a probability of 0 or 1. Regardless, sometimes we just don't know what particular state a system is in.
