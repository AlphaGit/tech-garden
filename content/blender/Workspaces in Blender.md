Workspaces are the different layouts in the Blender application that are setup to more efficiently work in different aspects of the [[Rendering workflow]].

They're basically a setup of the tools available, with a name. I have used this in other tasks, but Blender does them real justice. In all of the work that you can do in Blender, the workspaces are properly setup to reflect a "stage" in which you'd work.

The [[Layout Workspace]], for example, is where you'd do all your... layout (d'oh), which is ages before you get to the point of [[animating]], [[shading]] or [[rendering]]. So, pay attention to that.
