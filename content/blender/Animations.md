Animations are nothing more than the sequential rendering of multiple frames. These frames will display your set of objects from the point of view of a [[camera]] and will render, step by step, what these objects are doing through time.

## Formats
The format of an animation can be selected from the [[Scene property sheet]], under the Output set of options. Blender can output an animation in different formats. As of Blender 3.1, these are:

- Image formats
	- **BMP**: A sequence of [[BMP]] files.
	- **Iris**
	- **PNG**: A sequence of [[PNG]] files.
	- **JPEG**: A secuence of [[JPEG]] files.
	- **JPEG 2000**: A sequence of [[JPEG#^a84ce8|JPEG]] files.
	- **Targa**
	- **Targa Raw**
	- **Cineon**
	- **DPX**
	- **OpenEXR MultiLayer**
	- **OpenEXR**
	- **Radiance HDR**
	- **TIFF**
- Video formats:
	- **AVI JPEG**: An [[AVI]] animation where each frame is a [[JPEG]] file.
	- **AVI Raw**
	- **FFmpeg Video**
